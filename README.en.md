## About the project

Portfolio App is a local app for quickly creating a portfolio without manual layout work.  
Everything is managed inside the application: you create themes, add projects, upload covers, write descriptions, switch the interface language, and export a ready-made website for publishing.

This project is useful for:
- personal portfolios;
- student projects;
- work showcases;
- quickly building a website without a CMS.

## Localization and bilingual mode

- A `RU / EN` switch is available in the top-right corner of the main app area and changes the language of the entire interface.
- The selected language is stored in the local application data and reused on the next launch.
- If `Two-language support` is disabled, the exported website is generated in a single language: the one selected in the app at export time.
- If `Two-language support` is enabled, the forms show additional fields for Russian and English text:
  - theme name;
  - developer name and bio;
  - project title;
  - project description;
  - additional project information.
- In bilingual mode, the exported website gets its own built-in language switch and still remains fully static.
- Content translation is manual on purpose: this keeps the site autonomous, avoids external APIs, and preserves compatibility with GitHub Pages.

## How export works

The app saves data locally and can export a ready-made website into a separate folder.

The export includes:

* `index.html`
* `styles.css`
* `script.js`
* `data.json`
* project images
* developer photo

Export respects the current language settings:

- if bilingual mode is disabled, the site is exported in one selected language only;
- if bilingual mode is enabled, the site includes a `RU / EN` switch and both text variants that were filled in.

The exported site stays fully static: it can be opened locally in a browser or uploaded to standard hosting right away.

## Where data is stored

Local app data, photos, covers, and language settings are stored in the application's user directory.
This keeps projects safe after restarting the app.
