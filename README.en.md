## How export works

The app saves data locally and can export a ready-made website into a separate folder.

The export includes:

* `index.html`
* `styles.css`
* `script.js`
* `data.json`
* project images
* developer photo

The exported site can be opened in a browser or uploaded to hosting right away.

## Where data is stored

Local app data, photos, and covers are stored in the application's user directory.
This keeps projects safe after restarting the app.
